#The quick start with PML-Desktop is used as an example. Besides, PML-Server also shares the
#same process as it uses the similar script as PML-Desktop does.
# 1. Make sure Perl together with its modules and JAVA VM are installed.
# 2. Open a command line window and locate the work path under the folder (use cd command),
#    then type in:
#       perl pml_desktop.pl quick_start
# 3. The process would be completed in few seconds, and the results can be found in
#       ‘pml/results/quick_start/results.html’
#More examples can be found and tried in pml/examples. The details of each example can be
#found in each annotation and the README file in the folder
