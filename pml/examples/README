In order to make users comprehend the functions more expediently, some simple examples are provided and could be accessed and utilized from pml/examples. Descriptions are as below:

1.single_method_classify/ single_method_regress
  Simplest script. Only one method of modeling is utilized.

2.single_method_PO_classify/ single_method_PO_regress
  Script with only one method of some changed parameters of modeling.

3.muti_method_classify/ muti_method_regress
  Script with two methods of modeling

4.muti_method_PO_classify/ muti_method_PO_regress
  Script with two methods of some changed parameters of modeling.

5.muti_method_Clu_PO_classify/ muti_method_Clu_PO_regress
  Script with methods of cluster and modeling, and the changed parameters are provided for both cluster and modeling methods

6.muti_method_Fea_PO_classify/ muti_method_ Fea _PO_regress
  Script with methods of variable selection and modeling, and the changed parameters are provided for both variable selection and modeling methods

7.muti_method_Clu_Fea_PO_classify/ muti_method_Clu_Fea_PO_regress
  Script with methods of cluster, variable selection and modeling, and the sequence is cluster -- variable selection – modeling. The changed parameters are provided for all of the methods

8.muti_method_Fea_Clu_PO_classify/ muti_method_Fea_Clu_PO_regress
  Script with methods of cluster, variable selection and modeling, and the sequence is variable selection -- cluster – modeling. The changed parameters are provided for all of the methods

9.test_data_classify/ test_data_regress
  Script to demonstrate the use of the test data for modeling tasks. Note that the value of OUTER_FOLDS needs to be set as 1.

10.test_data_serial_classify/ test_data_serial_regress
   Script to demonstrate the use of serial file to generate test data for modeling tasks. Note that the value of OUTER_FOLDS needs to be set as 1.

11.train_outer_serial_classify/ train_outer_serial_regress
   Script to demonstrate the use of serial file with serial of test data to generate the train/test data for n-fold cross validation. The train data here will be generated by the remainder of the provided data. 

12.train_outer_serial_classify/ train_outer_serial_regress
   Script to demonstrate the use of serial file with serial of train data to generate the train/test data for n-fold cross validation. The test data here will be generated by the remainder of the provided data. 

13.test_inner_serial_classify/test_inner_serial_regress
   Script to demonstrate the use of serial file with serial of test data to generate the train/test data for inner n-fold cross validation. Note that the serial files for respective outer folds needs to be provided by parameter OUTER_FOLD_TEST_FILES_SERIAL or OUTER_FOLD_TRAIN_FILES_SERIAL.

14.train_inner_serial_classify/ train_inner_serial_regress
   Script to demonstrate the use of serial file with serial of train data to generate the train/test data for inner n-fold cross validation. Note that the serial files for respective outer folds needs to be provided by OUTER_FOLD_TEST_FILES_SERIAL or OUTER_FOLD_TRAIN_FILES_SERIAL.
